# Self To System

Self To System is a simple Android example app that can install itself as a system app. Its purpose is to demonstrate the capabilities of its core functionality, the SystemAppUtilities class.

The SystemAppUtilities class can be used by any app to make it capable to install itself as a system app. This can be used to extend the apps capabilities and make it resistant to factory resets.

This example app also shows some information about its user and system apk. But it has no practical functionality.

Every button shows an information dialog before doing anything. You can continue or cancel.
